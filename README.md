This project is one of the many projects under Initiative Z, an initiative formed by scholars of UCSI University whose aim is to transform the campus into a zero-waste campus.

Under this project, a reverse vending machine is to be built to encourage recycling among students on campus by giving out rewards. As part of the team responsible to create the computer vision system to separate collected waste, this repository keeps track of all progress done.

Goal: To produce an object detection model capable of detecting the different types of waste that will be collected such as plastic bottles, aluminium cans, glass bottles, paper, cardboard etc, starting with plastic bottles and aluminium cans first.

Disclaimer: The dataset used in this project originated from the Kaggle trashnet dataset. Link here: https://www.kaggle.com/feyzazkefe/trashnet. The dataset has since been modified for specific use of this project. Full dataset will be uploaded for the benefit of the online community once the project is complete.
